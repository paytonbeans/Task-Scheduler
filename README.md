# Task-Scheduler
A project in creating scheduling algorithms. SJF, FIFO and Round Robin

Command line output for task scheduling.

Task lists are inout through command line argument. Two example task lists are included in the repo in in1 and in2

This programs allows up to 26 tasks to be scheduled. The limit is arbitrary as I used the set of capital letters
for proccess ids so this can easily be expanded but for my purposes there wasn't a need.
